Um I think one of the things that like really stands out to me is just he's got such good energy and he's so welcoming and he's just such a lovely person. And I think I really felt that especially when we were electronic music for the first time when I first like really got to know him, and I remember me and Jesse in the bleachers. We just turned to talk to him and he would just be the most friendly, fun person and he was always matches. I feel like he matches the awesome, passionate freak all the time. Like he's always up for being passionate about something. He's super incredible and full of love and light and I just love his approach to music. He's one of the most creative people I know and yeah and it's just like there's so many things about him that he really like he just really knows himself and there's so many things about him that are so utterly unique and I just think it's great and he's so kind and so smart and so dedicated to making sure that like it's like activism stuff like that. Like that's something I really admire about him is the work he's put into like standing up for people and yeah I mean I just think it's like there's so many things about him that I feel like he's such a amazing leader and person to be around and I'm so glad he's my friend. And I love how he texts. It's so great.It's just so full of passion. And I yeah I just hope he has the best birthday. I hope you laugh around the sun. </span>

      <p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY EVAN!!! I know we haven’t know each other for very long, but I AM SO GLAD WE MET! I’ve never encountered anyone who I’ve clicked so fast with. Like literally on the same wavelength, going to the same places, similar interests… honestly I think it’s the Chinese in us… trust 😤. But anyways, I love your humour, your kindness, and the way you make your environment (aura) circling you feel so so safe, and comfortable. You are so charismatic, and it’s been a blast talking abt random things and random times for random brief conversations with you. I hope our paths will cross more as the years further progress. ALSO WE NEED TO PLAY SOMME JAZZ TOGETHER SOMETIME!!!</span>

         <br><b>-Charlie S</b>

	<p> Happy birthday, Evan! You’re seventeen now!!! I am so insanely grateful I have the privilege of being your friend (no….best friend). You are genuinely one of the sweetest and most generous people I have ever met. I can’t believe it hasn’t even been a year we’ve been friends! And I still can’t believe we didn’t become friends earlier - I feel like we’ve known each other so much longer, that’s how seamlessly you fit into my life. You have so, so much ahead of you and I’m so glad I (definitely, maybe?) get the honour of being part of your life as you find out what your (very bright) future holds. Thank you so much for being as awesome as you are, I look forward to many more gossip sessions and movie nights with you. I hope you have the most excellent birthday, Evan. Party on dude!! </span>

         <br><b>-Syd Puskas</b>

      <p>Grade twelves used to scare the shit out of me. Most of them still do. I’m not sure if it’s some past trauma that set in, but forever the reason, I was convinced my group of friends would be limited to a handful of people from my grade who already knew me. Meeting you has been startlingly fantastic. For one, you are one of the funniest people I’ve ever met, with your side eyes and sarcasm and contagious laughter. You’re also incredibly kind, and didn’t hesitate to offer Shay and I a hand when we were nervous grade tens just trying to make a difference. You’re a ginormous nerd, it’s ok, me too, and I love hearing more and more about lord of the rings and what choir song you can’t wait to suggest next. I also can’t wait for you to tumble down the rabbit hole of Dungeons and Dragons with us, if you’re willing. Sitting next to you during Chicago was a desperately needed dose of socialization, and I loved finding someone who matched my overzealous giddy energy.  When it comes to beautiful, seventeen year old humans, it’s hard to top Evan Morin. Thank you for gracing us with your presence this year, and I hope our friendship can continue to grow in the future 🫶🫶</span>

      <p>Evan is a cool guy and one of my closest friends ever</span>
         <br><b>-Ruby</b>

      <p>I want to be just like Evan when I grow up. There is literally nothing unlikable about him. Seriously!</span>
         <br><b>-Alec</b>

	<p>Evan you have the most plump bodacious buttocks I have ever had the pleasure of laying my eyes on. I love when you walk into the theatre and I get to go “hi Evan!” And wave. Your boyfriend is also awesome and very crackable, great work on that.</span>
         <br><b>-Alex</b>

      <p>Evan is amazing and always dependable and someone who can uplift anyone near him</span>
         <br><b>-Shay</b>

      <p>Evan you are so locked in with band I have no clue how you do anything in the alto section without your fingers exploding. you’re a pretty cool dude who has a lot of nerd knowledge on Star Trek (which I have just started watching) and that’s pretty dope. Thanks for being my friend!</span>
         <br><b>-Edward</b>

	<p>Happy birthday Evan!!!!! Out of everyone I’ve met in my high school time you by far have had one of the biggest impacts! I am so glad we met so early, and especially in a musical environment where you really shine. You are such a clever, talented, and tasteful guy, and i feel so excited everyday when I know I get to walk into class knowing I’m about to have the most rewarding conversations. Keep being you always! You are really fantastic!
I hope maybe one day we can open our little café by day club by night!</span>
	<br><b>-Kiki</b>

      <p>I still remember sitting next to Evan on one of the first days of band and it was really nice meeting someone so friendly right at the beginning of high school. The sheer amount of things he does and is incredibly good at is ridiculously impressive, and I really admire the skill and the time put into everything he does. I don't know how to end this but yeah</span>

      <p>Mr Evan is very awesome</span>
