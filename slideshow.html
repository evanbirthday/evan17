<p> If you didn’t know already, you are my first boyfriend (or any partner) EVER and I am so glad it’s you. Those first few weeks and really that first date was sooo nerv-wracking for me since i just got out of a pretty messy situationship and you have been nothing but lovely and awesome and oh so nice to be around. I love you so much and you may be like oooooh that hair is so bad oooh (because you said this before!) just for a #fyi i will always love you no matter what form you take; solid, liquid or gas. Cause like I'm lowkey gay</p>

<p>Going places is fun too! The three parties we’ve been to together (with the same people) have been so fun and I love doing things with you anywhere. Being in your presence just fills me with so much joy and I wish EVERY day was your birthday so I can tell you how much I love you without you exploding everywhere. Maybe I want that actually… Smirking hamster.</p>

<p style="color:lightblue;">You’re the best boyfriend ever, I fear</p>
